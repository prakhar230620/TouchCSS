# SEO Basics

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.

## The `<title>` Tag

The title tag is one of the most important on-page SEO factors. It appears in the search results as the clickable headline.

```html
<head>
  <title>Blue Widget - Buy High Quality Widgets | WidgetCo</title>
</head>
```

## Meta Description

The meta description provides a summary of the page content. Search engines often display the meta description in search results below the title.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Buy the best blue widgets in the world. High quality, low price, and fast shipping.">
```

## Heading Tags (H1-H6)

Use headings to provide structure and context for your article. H1 should describe the main topic of the page.

## Valid HTML

Writing valid HTML code helps search engines understand your content better.
Use the `alt` attribute on images to help search engines understand what image is about.
