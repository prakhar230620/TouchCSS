# Basic HTML Tags

In this lesson, we will cover the most common HTML tags you will use.

## Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

## Paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

## Links

HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag. The link's destination is specified in the `href` attribute.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
```

## Images

HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag.
The source file (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), `width`, and `height` are provided as attributes.

```html
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```
